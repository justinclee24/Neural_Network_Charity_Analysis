# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis


## Results
### Data Preprocessing
#### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- The variable to be considered as the target output is the IS_SUCCESSFUL column, representing whether the funding toward a certain cause was successful.
#### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- Features in the model include APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT.
#### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
- Variables that should be removed from the input data are EIN and NAME.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
#### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- The initial model implemented two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons, respectively.
#### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- 
#### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
-
